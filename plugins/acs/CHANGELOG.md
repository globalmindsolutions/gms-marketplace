# Changelog

All notable changes to the `acs` plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Releases are automated: bump `version` in BOTH
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `plugins/acs/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
to the same value, point the acs `source.ref` in `marketplace.json` at
`v<version>`, add a matching section here, and merge to `main` — the Release
workflow tags `v<version>` and publishes a GitHub release using that section as
the notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`/acs:code` enforces Simplicity First + Surgical Changes restraint layer
  (MAR-2).** The code-executor's Charter gains two named authoring rules:
  **Simplicity First** (minimum code that solves the spec — no speculative
  features, no single-use abstractions, no unrequested configurability, no
  impossible-case error handling; if 200 lines can be 50, rewrite; apply the
  "would a senior engineer call this overcomplicated?" check) and **Surgical
  Changes** (every changed line traces to the spec; do not refactor or reformat
  adjacent code; only remove orphans your own change created; mention but never
  delete pre-existing dead code). The code-planner's file-map step now directs
  the minimal change surface and prohibits speculative scope. The
  code-verifier gains a new blocking **Simplicity & scope** dimension (dimension
  12) that flags overcomplication and out-of-scope edits as blocking findings
  looped back to the executor. Mirrored in the `/acs:code` SKILL doc and the
  shared requirements docs (skills.md, reflection.md). Generalizes the v0.3.1
  minimal-comment policy from comments-only to a full authoring-discipline
  contract.
- **`/acs:code`, `/acs:create-ticket`, `/acs:create-pr`, `/acs:merge-pr`
  reconcile the acs ticket id with the GitHub issue/PR (MAR-75).** Tracker
  sync now cross-references the acs ticket id and its GitHub records
  bidirectionally and GitHub-natively. `/acs:create-ticket` Step 5 stamps the
  acs ticket id on the synced issue body (`acs-ticket: {ticket_id}`, via the
  task/story/epic description templates) and fills the issue's GitHub fields —
  `ACS` + type labels, assignee when known, milestone when the repo uses one,
  and applicable Project fields (Status, Type) — surfacing, never silently
  skipping, a field the Project schema does not define. `/acs:create-pr` adds a
  native `Closes #<external.key>` bullet to the PR body's `## Ticket` section
  (so GitHub auto-links and auto-closes the issue on merge) and passes
  `--milestone` when one is used. `/acs:merge-pr`'s issue-close comment now
  carries the acs ticket id and a PR back-reference
  (`Merged {ticket_id} via PR #{pr.number} — {pr.url}`). `local`/unsynced
  tickets are unaffected; no enforced `pr_title`/`branch_name`/`commit_message`
  format string and no placeholder vocabulary changed.

### Fixed

- **`/acs:create-ticket` now syncs every fanned-out epic child to the tracker,
  not just the root ticket (MAR-84).** Epic children minted during Step 4 fan-out
  were never pushed to GitHub/Jira — Step 5's sync sequence only ever ran once,
  for the root, leaving every child's `external` `null`. Step 5 (both
  `create-ticket/SKILL.md` and `create-ticket-executor.md`) now defines a
  "tickets to sync" set (`root, unless imported` + `every child minted in Step
  4`, excluding product-flow delivery titles) and wraps the existing
  `gh`/`acli` sequence in a per-ticket loop, reusing the field-fill checklist
  verbatim for each ticket. A new stdlib-only helper,
  `plugins/acs/hooks/scripts/record-external.py`, is the deterministic write
  seam that stamps `external = {provider, key}` into one ticket's own
  `ticket.json` (and refuses, as defense in depth, to write onto a
  product-flow ticket). A per-ticket `gh`/`acli` failure is surfaced as a
  finding naming the ticket id and error and no longer aborts the rest of the
  batch — the loop continues, and the failed ticket's `external` stays `null`
  for a later retry. Product-flow delivery tickets ("Product definition
  (PRD)", "Product architecture doc set") remain unsynced by design.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **`/acs:init` now detects and auto-repairs a consumer `CLAUDE.md` that an
  earlier buggy run corrupted, and reports the repair.** v0.3.2 stopped the writer
  from *producing* a doubled block, but a repo already carrying a doubled or
  orphaned block (e.g. `2 BEGIN / 3 END` from the old `find`-based non-idempotency)
  still needed a human to hand-edit it. Step 7e now reads `CLAUDE.md` before
  writing, and when the new pure detector `acs_lib.managed_block_is_malformed`
  reports marker counts other than one `<!-- BEGIN acs-managed … -->` / one
  `<!-- END acs-managed -->`, the same `upsert_managed_block` collapses the entire
  span (first `BEGIN` → last `END`, `rfind`) to a single clean pair and
  `_strip_stray_markers` scrubs any orphan marker left in the surrounding text, so
  no doubled block or orphan `END` survives the next run. The step prints
  `repaired malformed acs-managed block in CLAUDE.md (was N BEGIN / M END -> 1/1)`
  and surfaces the repair in the completion report's Results/Findings, so a repair
  is never mistaken for a routine refresh. A first-time insert into a block-less
  `CLAUDE.md` is correctly reported as a normal write, not a repair. The heal
  preserves the user-owned content before and after the block byte-for-byte and is
  itself idempotent. Re-run `/acs:init` once to collapse any lingering corruption.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- **`/acs:init` no longer writes a doubled, non-idempotent acs-managed block into
  the consumer `CLAUDE.md`.** Step 7e used to read the whole `CLAUDE.acs.md`
  template — which already ships a complete block (maintainer header + its own
  `BEGIN`/`END` markers) — and wrap it in a *second* marker pair, producing two
  `<!-- BEGIN acs-managed … -->` and two `<!-- END acs-managed -->` with the
  header sandwiched between them. Re-running degraded the file further because the
  writer located the closing marker with `find` (the inner `END`), orphaning the
  outer one. The writer now injects only the guidance **body** (new
  `acs_lib.managed_body_from_template`, which drops the header and the template's
  own markers) wrapped in exactly one pair, and `upsert_managed_block` locates the
  span with `rfind` and defensively strips any stray markers from the body. Result:
  a fresh write yields a single clean pair, re-runs are byte-identical, and a
  pre-existing doubled/legacy block self-heals to one clean pair — all while
  preserving the surrounding user-owned content byte-for-byte. Step 7e also gains a
  post-write self-check asserting a single marker pair. Re-run `/acs:init` to
  collapse an already-doubled block in an existing repo.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-29

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md managed block now steers ticket work to `/acs:code` / `/acs:ship`
  and explains why hand-made PRs fail the gate.** The `/acs:init`-installed
  guidance (`CLAUDE.acs.md`) tells the assistant to implement/code a ticket via
  `/acs:code <ticket-id>` (or `/acs:ship`) and let `/acs:create-pr` open the PR,
  never a raw `gh pr create`. It makes the mechanism explicit: the pipeline
  renders the branch/title/body/label from **the project's own**
  `.acs/settings.json` formats, and the CI convention gate validates against the
  same file — so a pipeline-produced PR passes by construction while a hand-made
  one bypasses the rendering and fails. Re-run `/acs:init` to refresh the block
  in an existing repo.

- **`/acs:code` writes minimal, idea-only code comments (token discipline).**
  The code-executor now writes at most one short single-responsibility line per
  new function/class (SOLID — one unit, one job), never puts a ticket id in
  source comments or docstrings, and on edits only touches a comment the change
  actually invalidates (e.g. a changed parameter) — no re-comment passes over
  unchanged logic. Mirrored in the code-planner's documentation map and the
  `/acs:code` SKILL doc step. The `commit_message` format (which carries the
  ticket id) is unchanged.

- **Corrected stale agent-topology references to the post-MAR-60 shape.**
  `docs/requirements/overview.md` and `plugins/acs/docs/INTERNALS.md` no longer
  describe the old "27 subagents / 9 planner-executor-verifier triples" topology
  that predates apply-tier inlining (MAR-60); the counts now reflect the current
  triad-vs-inline split.

- **`/acs:code` doc-sync now reconciles factual prd.md/roadmap.md claims and
  flags intent divergence (MAR-65).** Execute step 4 is extended so the
  executor reconciles FACTUAL claims in `docs/product/prd.md` and
  `docs/product/roadmap.md` as part of the same changeset diff (agent/subagent
  counts, feature/epic shipped-vs-planned status, component topology, version
  numbers, file path references). Intent content (goals, NFR targets, scope,
  vision, requirements rationale) remains `/acs:create-prd`-owned: when a
  changeset contradicts stated intent, the executor flags the divergence in its
  execute-report `problems` field (surfaced in the coordinator result document
  and PR body) and NEVER rewrites intent content. The code-planner's
  documentation map now assesses prd/roadmap factual impact; the
  code-verifier's Documentation-consistency dimension (dimension 11) makes a
  stale factual claim a blocking finding and an intent contradiction an explicit
  flagged divergence (not a block). ADR-0007 is amended inline to record the
  extended scope, the factual-vs-intent boundary, the divergence rationale, and
  the enforcement note (status remains Accepted).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Complexity-adaptive delivery — four-lane routing from size × stakes
  (MAR-56).** `/acs:create-ticket` now classifies each ticket on two
  user-confirmed axes (`size`, `stakes`) and derives a deterministic `lane`
  (`TRIVIAL` / `SMALL` / `STANDARD` / `COMPLEX`) via `derive_lane()`, persisted
  to `ticket.json`, `pipeline-state.json`, and `tickets-index.json`. The lane
  drives how much process the pipeline applies; the default is full/standard
  rigor and lighter lanes are opt-in (rigor is never silently dropped).

- **Verifier-as-gate with lane-driven verify depth (MAR-58).** acs is
  autonomous-first: the verifier subagent is the in-loop quality gate on
  *every* lane (it always runs). `verify_depth(size, stakes)` scales only the
  iteration ceiling — `light` (single pass, `VERIFY_ITERATION_CAP["light"]=1`)
  for TRIVIAL/SMALL low/normal-stakes tickets, `full` (up to 3 iterations + the
  11-dimension review + e2e when configured) for STANDARD/COMPLEX and all
  high-stakes tickets — with a high-stakes floor to `full`. The TDD/coverage
  gate runs in full in every lane and is never trimmed by depth selection.

- **Trivial/small fast-lane: spec authoring folded into `/code` (MAR-59).** On
  the TRIVIAL/SMALL lanes, `gate_code` no longer requires a standalone
  `/acs:create-spec` run or a populated `specs/` directory; spec authoring
  (with acceptance criteria mapped to tests) is folded into `/acs:code`'s plan
  phase by the code-planner, and `/acs:ship` skips the standalone create-spec
  step for those lanes. STANDARD/COMPLEX/absent/unknown lanes stay fail-closed
  on the full create-spec path. The TDD/coverage hard-fail and verifier-as-gate
  (light cap 1, no inline human gate) are preserved on the fast lane.

- **Apply-tier inlining: create-pr / merge-pr / create-ticket run inline
  (MAR-60).** The three apply-work skills run deterministic-inline (coordinator
  + at most one executor), never a planner/executor/verifier triad, in every
  lane — generalizing the proven merge-pr exempt-PR inline shape. Every
  load-bearing apply step, post-hook, and canonical `states` key is preserved;
  the six triad-keeping skills (create-spec, code, create-prd, create-design,
  create-architecture, create-project) are unchanged. ~$0.10 inline vs ~$0.70
  triad per apply step (G14/G15).

- **Mid-flight lane escalation, upward-only (MAR-57).** A ticket whose true
  size/stakes turn out higher than its classification is automatically
  escalated to a higher-rigor lane mid-run (on the first higher-stakes signal:
  a verifier finding, a touched `high_stakes_paths` glob, or an explicit
  request) — recomputing lane + verify depth via `escalate_lane()` and
  re-persisting, without restarting, and re-introducing any skipped stage.
  De-escalation is guaranteed never automatic or silent: no unattended path
  lowers a ticket's lane or authoritative size/stakes below a user-confirmed
  value (an interactive downgrade command is deferred to a later ticket).

- **`/acs:init` prompts for per-role models on a fresh init.** Model selection
  is now a first-class setup step: a Recommended preset
  (planner/verifier/coordinator = opus, executor = sonnet), Inherit-session-
  model, or Custom per role. Re-runs only ask whether to change current values.

- **Behavioral-eval coverage for all 16 skills.** The `skill_triggers` routing
  eval now covers every skill: the 14 model-invocable ones by description, and
  the 2 user-only ones (`install-hooks`, `update`) by an explicit-invocation
  probe plus a negative-routing probe that asserts `disable-model-invocation`
  is honored. A new free, deterministic `update_migration` scenario certifies
  `/acs:update`'s local logic offline — numeric semver comparison
  (installed vs latest) and the Step-6 migration checks (settings validate
  against the schema; workspace requirement enforced).

### Changed

- **PRD/roadmap reconciled to the shipped verifier-as-gate model.** The
  complexity-adaptive PRD/roadmap previously described a three-tier model that
  dropped the verifier on trivial tickets behind a human-approval gate; the
  docs now describe the autonomous-first model that actually shipped (verifier
  gates on every lane; lane-driven verify depth; no inline human-approval gate;
  PR review is the human checkpoint).

- **In-process stdlib XML validation is now the default fast path (MAR-61).**
  `validate_xml.py` now validates every message via the in-process
  `validate_structurally()` engine (pure stdlib, zero subprocess) instead of
  spawning `xmllint` per message.  `xmllint` is retained as an opt-in
  authoritative check via `ACS_XML_AUTHORITATIVE=1` (PATH-guarded; absent
  xmllint never blocks a verdict).  The in-process engine matches xmllint for
  the following covered violation classes: bad root element, missing/invalid
  attribute, bad ticket-id pattern, out-of-order children, wrong list-item tag,
  bad status/severity enum, duplicate maxOccurs=1 sequence children
  (cardinality), xs:decimal grammar for cost-usd (no exponent, no inf/nan, no
  underscores), and the closed content model — undeclared attributes (the XSD
  has no anyAttribute/wildcard) and element children inside text-only
  (xs:string) leaves are both rejected, matching xmllint.  A parity corpus
  (`TestValidators` in `tests/acs/test_acs_plugin.py`) asserts identical
  pass/fail verdicts for each of these classes across both paths.

- **`validate_batch()` / `batch_overall_ok()` — new Python-callable batch
  validation API (MAR-61 AC-4).** `validate_batch(messages)` accepts a list
  of XML message strings and returns a per-message `(ok, errors)` tuple list
  in a single call with zero subprocess spawns; `batch_overall_ok(results)`
  returns `False` when any member is invalid.  The batch API calls the
  in-process `validate_structurally()` engine and is importable directly from
  `validate_xml.py`; `main()` and the CLI are unchanged (AC-6 back-compat).

- **Clarify-batching coordinator contract (MAR-61 AC-7).** All 9 hooked
  coordinator skill bodies and `docs/requirements/skills.md` now document the
  grouped-ask rule: when ≥2 clarifications are open, the coordinator presents
  all of them in ONE grouped interaction instead of serial round-trips.  Each
  answer is recorded as its own `clarify.py add` entry (one `C-<n>` per
  question, `--source` preserved); no question may be skipped, merged, or
  auto-answered outside the existing `--source assumption --rationale "..."`
  rule.  A `TestClarifyBatchingContract` suite in `test_skill_contracts.py`
  asserts grouped-ask presence, per-question ledger-entry documentation, and
  zero-auto-answer documentation across all 9 skills.

- **`/acs:merge-pr` is now agent/model-invocable (MAR-42).** Removed
  `disable-model-invocation` from the skill; the readiness gate (CI, approvals,
  conflicts, protections) and the repo's branch protection are the merge brakes,
  by whoever invokes. Because invocation source (agent vs user) is not reliably
  detectable, an **approving review is now required for every merge** (mitigation
  m6, the require-APPROVED-for-all fallback; see
  [ADR 0028](../../docs/adr/0028-merge-pr-agent-invocable.md)) — including on
  repos that require no review. `/acs:ship` still stops at create-pr. Authorised
  by the PRD Vision amendment in MAR-45.

### Fixed

- **`acs-conventions` workflow no longer cancels its own required check (MAR-43).**
  The concurrency block previously used `cancel-in-progress: true`. When a PR is
  created with `gh pr create --label ACS`, the `pull_request` trigger fires for
  both `opened` and `labeled` near-simultaneously, producing two runs in the same
  concurrency group. The cancelled run left a non-SUCCESS conclusion on the
  required "Branch / PR / commit conventions" check, which branch protection
  treated as unmet and blocked the PR (observed as PR #96). Setting
  `cancel-in-progress: false` in both `plugins/acs/templates/ci/acs-conventions.yml`
  and `.github/workflows/acs-conventions.yml` lets all concurrent runs complete;
  GitHub records the latest run's conclusion. The per-PR concurrency group is
  retained for cross-PR isolation.

### Added

- **Two-skill metrics split: `/acs:metrics` (PM view) + `/acs:usage` (usage view) (MAR-14).**
  The former single-view `/acs:metrics` skill is split into two narrowly-scoped
  utility skills over one shared stdlib aggregator:

  - **`/acs:usage`** is a new model-invocable utility skill (skill count 15 → 16,
    unhooked) that renders the **usage view**: usage summary (total cost, total
    working time, total runs, plus four averages — avg working time per ticket and
    per merged PR, avg cost per ticket and per merged PR), cost + time per ticket
    by pipeline step with the four averages (Panel 3), and token burn by role
    (Panel 6). Backed by `metrics_aggregate.py` (shared superset) then
    `metrics_render.py --view usage`. Read-only; no network call; no config key.

  - **`/acs:metrics`** is re-scoped to the **PM view**: delivery summary (headline
    KPIs — tickets done/total, PRs merged, avg lead/cycle, coverage pass rate),
    throughput by status/type (Panel 1), pipeline funnel + distinct PRs (Panel 2),
    ISSUES (id/title/status/type/GitHub key), PROGRESS (per-epic done/total +
    burn-up visual), DEADLINE ("not set" degraded frame — deadline tracking requires
    a `due_date` ticket field, wired in Child 3 / MAR-15), coverage achieved vs
    target (Panel 4), review iterations before the verifier passed (Panel 5), and
    lead + cycle time per ticket (Panel 7). Invokes `metrics_render.py --view pm`.

  **Shared mechanism.** `metrics_aggregate.py` emits one superset JSON carrying all
  panel keys for both views (the PM union usage full set; no panel appears in both
  views). `metrics_render.py` gains four new view entrypoints —
  `render_pm_terminal`, `render_pm_html`, `render_usage_terminal`,
  `render_usage_html` — selected by the new `--view {pm,usage}` CLI flag (bare
  `metrics_render.py` with no `--view` defaults to the PM view; both skills invoke
  the renderer with the flag explicitly). The existing `render_terminal` /
  `render_html` entrypoints and `--view all` remain for back-compat.

  **DEADLINE panel** ships as a "not set" B1-compliant degraded frame in this
  release (the panel key is always present; it renders "not set" without error).
  Child 3 / MAR-15 wires real due-date data via a `due_date` field on the ticket.

- **Ticket `due_date` field + live DEADLINE panel (MAR-15).** The DEADLINE panel
  in `/acs:metrics` (PM view) now derives and displays real on-track/overdue
  status from each ticket's `due_date`:

  - **`due_date` on `ticket.json`** is a new optional ISO-8601 date field
    (`YYYY-MM-DD` or null; additive, back-compatible — existing tickets with no
    `due_date` are valid and the panel degrades gracefully to "not set").
    `/acs:create-ticket` elicits and sets `due_date`; the `--due-date` option on
    `new-ticket.py` accepts and validates the value (malformed input is rejected
    with a non-zero exit).
  - **DEADLINE panel — live derivation.** `metrics_aggregate.py` reads each
    ticket's `due_date` (from the `ticket.json` already opened per ticket) and
    derives: *overdue* when `due_date < now` and the ticket is not done;
    *on-track* otherwise.  The panel shows one row per ticket with a `due_date`,
    plus a roll-up summary.  A workspace with no parseable `due_date` on any
    ticket degrades to the "not set" state (B1 — the panel key is always
    present; no crash).  An empty workspace keeps `deadline == "no data"`.
  - **Read-only.** Aggregator and renderer write nothing; the only new write is
    `due_date` at create-ticket.  No network call; no new config key.
    Deterministic: the reference "now" is the same instant stamped into
    `meta.generated_at` (pinnable in tests); the renderer reads no clock.

  This supersedes the MAR-14 interim "not set" degraded frame.

- **Distinct-PR counting via `created_pr_numbers` + idempotent backfill (MAR-13 spec 01).**
  `prs.created` in `metrics.json` now counts **distinct PRs** rather than completed
  `create-pr` run invocations — a single PR re-triggered multiple times no longer
  inflates the metric.  `update_metrics` gains an optional `pr_number` parameter;
  when `pr_created` is truthy and `pr_number` is a positive integer not already
  recorded, it is appended to a sorted de-duped `prs.created_pr_numbers` list and
  `prs.created` is set to `len(created_pr_numbers)` (idempotent: re-runs with the
  same number are a no-op).  A one-time idempotent `backfill_distinct_pr_count`
  helper heals already-inflated history by recomputing `created_pr_numbers` from
  the distinct positive `states.pr.number` values across all active and `archive/`
  partitions; re-running it is safe and produces the same result.  The
  `created_pr_numbers` field is additive on the `prs` object (no schema break); all
  other metric paths (`tokens`, `cost_usd`, `prs.merged`, ticket counts) are
  unchanged.  No new runtime dependency; no network call.
- **Lead/cycle re-cycle hardening + per-ticket re-work count (MAR-13 spec 02).**
  Panel 7 (`metrics_aggregate.py`) now carries an explicit overlap-safe guarantee:
  `aggregate()` never raises when a ticket's `code.started_at` falls after its
  `merge-pr.ended_at` (a re-cycled or overlapping step span) — the affected
  `cycle_seconds` value renders as `"no data"` and a `meta.degraded` entry (panel 7)
  is appended; one row per ticket is always returned; nothing is written.  This
  guarantee is documented in the `_elapsed_seconds` and `_panel7_row` docstrings and
  is now covered by a dedicated cycle-inversion test
  (`test_cycle_inversion_yields_no_data`).  In addition, each Panel-7 per-ticket row
  gains a new additive `rework_count` integer field (>= 0) equal to the count of
  distinct positive PR numbers recoverable from that ticket's `create-pr-state.json`
  in the resolved partition; 0 when the file is absent, malformed, or carries no
  positive PR number.  `rework_count` is read-only (zero writes), stdlib-only, and
  is not averaged at the panel level — it is per-ticket metadata next to
  `lead_seconds` / `cycle_seconds`.  No schema break; no new config key; no network
  call.
- **Pipeline-default `CLAUDE.md` guidance + exempt non-ticket merge path (MAR-9).**
  Two changes that make the acs pipeline the *automatic* path in an installed
  repo and close the non-ticket dead end. (1) `/acs:init` gains an opt-in
  (default-on) step that writes an idempotent, marker-delimited **acs-managed
  block** into the repo's `CLAUDE.md` (from the new `templates/CLAUDE.acs.md`),
  steering every Claude session to ship via `/acs:ship` instead of a raw
  `gh pr create` — re-runs replace only the block, never the surrounding
  content. (2) `/acs:merge-pr --pr <n>` (also `#n` or a PR URL) lands a
  legitimate one-off **exempt** PR: it runs the same four readiness checks and
  branch/worktree cleanup as the ticket path but resolves no ticket, writes no
  partition/state, and skips tracker sync and archiving (bumping only the repo
  `pr_merged` metric). `skill-start.py --pr` validates the PR carries the
  configured `exempt_label` (or an `exempt_branches` head) and refuses +
  redirects to `/acs:merge-pr <ticket-id>` when the PR looks ticket-backed. The
  existing ticket-backed merge flow and every other gate are unchanged.
- **`/acs:metrics` — read-only delivery dashboard (MAR-5).** A new
  model-invocable utility skill that renders dashboard panels for the current repo —
  throughput by status/type, pipeline funnel, cost and time per ticket by step,
  coverage achieved vs target, review iterations before the verifier passed, and
  token burn by role (planner/executor/verifier). Backed by the stdlib-only
  `metrics_aggregate.py` helper, which aggregates the panels from existing
  workspace artifacts and emits one JSON object (every panel key always present;
  degradation is an in-band "no data" marker, never a missing key). The skill is
  read-only: it writes no file, makes no network call, and adds no config key.
- **Deterministic cross-surface metrics renderer (MAR-5).** Rendering is now a
  deterministic stdlib helper `metrics_render.py` that consumes the aggregate
  JSON and emits the dashboard panels on two surfaces: a Unicode block-bar
  **terminal** dashboard for the Claude Code CLI (default) and a self-contained
  **HTML** component (`--html`, inline CSS, no external fetch) handed to
  `show_widget` verbatim on Claude Desktop / claude.ai. The skill now **routes**
  (aggregate → render) instead of model-composing the layout, and the
  deterministic terminal renderer **supersedes** the former model-improvised
  Markdown-table fallback. `metrics_render.py` is stdlib-only, never imports
  `show_widget`, is read-only, and is deterministic (identical JSON in →
  byte-identical output; no clock read in render) — unit-tested to the same 90%
  coverage bar as the aggregator.
- **`/acs:metrics` delivery-flow metrics (MAR-7).** The dashboard now surfaces
  delivery-flow timing on both render surfaces: **Panel 3** gains four **averages**
  summary rows — avg working time and avg cost, each per ticket and per merged PR
  (a zero denominator renders "no data") — and a **new Panel 7 — Lead + cycle time
  per ticket** shows per-ticket **lead** (`ticket.json.created_at` → `merge-pr`
  end) and **cycle** (`code` start → `merge-pr` end) wall-clock times plus their
  averages, with humanized `d`/`h`/`m`/`s` durations. Aggregated additively in
  `metrics_aggregate.py` and rendered in `metrics_render.py` (terminal + HTML),
  read-only and deterministic, with every "no data" value rendering a present "no
  data" cell — no schema, config, or network change.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **`/acs:init` toolchain preflight (Step 0b).** Init now checks every external
  tool the full workflow needs up front and offers to install the missing ones
  (consent-gated, platform-aware) instead of failing mid-pipeline on a missing
  `gh` or `pre-commit`. Backed by `acs_lib.check_toolchain()` — the single
  source of truth listing `git`, `python3`, `gh`, `pre-commit`, `xmllint`,
  `acli` with kind (required | recommended | optional, bumped by tracker
  provider) and per-platform install commands — plus `acs_lib.missing_tools()`.
  The Step 8 summary now also confirms the full skill set is ready.

- **CI enforcement of acs conventions (opt-in via `/acs:init`).** A new Step 7c
  offers to scaffold repo-side enforcement so a PR that never went through
  `/acs:create-pr` is still held to the same conventions before it can merge.
  It installs:
  - `.github/workflows/acs-conventions.yml` — a `pull_request` check (re-runs on
    title/body edits and label changes) that validates **branch name**, **PR
    title**, **PR description sections**, the **`ACS` label**, and (opt-in)
    **commit-message** format.
  - `.acs/ci/check-conventions.py` — a self-contained, stdlib-only checker that
    compiles the committed `formats.*` strings into regexes (the same vocabulary
    the pipeline renders from) and reads `ticket_prefix` + `formats` from the
    committed `.acs/settings.json`; **no acs install is needed on the runner**.
    It is FAIL-CLOSED (no committed conventions → error + "run /acs:init") and
    runs in `--mode pr` (CI), `--mode pre-push`, or `--mode commit-msg` (local
    hooks) — the same checker and the same configured formats everywhere.
  - Optional **local git hooks** that enforce conventions *before* push, against
    the SAME configured `formats.*`/`enforcement.*`: `commit-msg` validates the
    commit subject against `formats.commit_message` as it is written, and
    `pre-push` validates `formats.branch_name` + the push range's commit
    subjects. Installed via the pre-commit framework (tracked, shared across the
    team) or as raw `.git/hooks/*` (per-clone). PR title/description stay CI-only
    (they don't exist until a PR is open).
  - New **`enforcement`** settings block (`schemas/settings.schema.json`):
    `checks.*` toggles, `exempt_branches` globs, `exempt_label`, `require_label`,
    and `pr_description_sections`.
- **New skill `/acs:install-hooks`** — the `pre-commit install` equivalent for
  acs: installs this clone's local `commit-msg` + `pre-push` hooks (per-clone,
  user-invoked). It ensures the `.acs/ci/` files exist (copying them from the
  plugin if needed), then installs via the pre-commit framework when the repo
  uses it or via raw git hooks otherwise. A committed `.acs/ci/install-hooks.sh`
  lets a teammate who only cloned the repo run it (`sh .acs/ci/install-hooks.sh`)
  without the acs plugin. `/acs:init` Step 7c now copies the hook scripts +
  installer into `.acs/ci/` and points at this command.
- **No-bypass gate guidance.** Because branch/title are cosmetic and the proof
  of pipeline use lives in the workspace outside the repo, the check is *mandatory
  to merge* but the real gate is a **required status check on a protected default
  branch**. Step 7c detects repo-admin (`gh api .permissions.admin`) and either
  configures branch protection via `gh api` or prints the one-time admin command,
  with a configurable **`acs-exempt` label + branch allowlist** escape hatch for
  releases and bot PRs.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- `/acs:init` now reliably gitignores `<repo>/.acs/settings.local.json`. The
  Step 5 ignore step is rewritten to run on **every** init (fresh and re-run,
  even when no keys changed), so a repo first initialized by an older acs that
  has the file but no ignore rule gets retro-fixed. It uses `git check-ignore`
  instead of an exact-line `grep` (a broader existing rule like `.acs/` now
  counts as ignored, so no duplicate line is appended) and guarantees a
  trailing newline before appending so the entry can't glue onto the last line
  of an existing `.gitignore`.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Unified release versioning: the marketplace catalog and the `acs` plugin now
  share **one version** and a single `v<version>` release tag. The separate
  `marketplace-v<version>` tag scheme and its workflow are retired. Cutting a
  release now bumps `version` in both `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and
  `plugins/acs/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to the same value and points the acs
  `git-subdir` `source.ref` at the new `v<version>` tag; CI enforces that the
  two versions match. Existing `marketplace-v*` tags remain valid in history.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Breaking**: marketplace `name` renamed from `gms-plugins` to `gms-marketplace`.
  Existing consumers must migrate:
  1. Rename the key in `extraKnownMarketplaces` (managed settings or
     `~/.claude/settings.json`) from `"gms-plugins"` to `"gms-marketplace"`.
  2. Re-run `claude plugin install acs@gms-marketplace` (the old
     `acs@gms-plugins` reference no longer resolves).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Plugin failed to install on current Claude Code (manifest validation:
  `Unrecognized key: "displayName"`), leaving `acs@gms-marketplace` uninstallable
  even after the v0.1.1 hooks fix. Removed the unsupported `displayName` key
  from `plugin.json`; the marketplace lists the plugin by `name` +
  `description`. Caught by the M2-0 validation spike
  ([docs/product/m2-0-validation-spike.md](../../docs/product/spikes/m2-0-validation-spike.md)).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- Plugin failed to load on install with "Duplicate hooks file detected"
  because `plugin.json` declared `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` — a file
  Claude Code already auto-loads by convention. Removed the redundant
  manifest key so the plugin loads cleanly on a fresh install (GMS-5).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

Initial release.

### Added

- Claude Code plugin marketplace manifest (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`)
  listing the `acs` plugin; install with
  `claude plugin marketplace add <github-url>`.
- 12 skills: `/acs:init`, `/acs:ship`, `/acs:handoff`, `/acs:create-prd`,
  `/acs:create-architecture`, `/acs:create-project`, `/acs:create-ticket`,
  `/acs:create-design`, `/acs:create-spec`, `/acs:code`, `/acs:create-pr`,
  `/acs:merge-pr`.
- 27 subagents: planner/executor/verifier triples for each of the 9 workflow
  and product-level skills, driving the plan -> execute -> verify reflection
  cycle (max 3 iterations).
- Hook-gated pipeline: a `PreToolUse` dispatcher plus pre/post hooks per
  hooked skill — each skill refuses to run (exit 2) until its predecessor's
  run completed, post-hooks finalize run state and release locks, and a
  `SessionEnd` safety net marks interrupted runs.
- Workspace state outside the consumer repo: per-ticket partitions
  (`ticket.json`, `pipeline-state.json`, `design.md`, `specs/`, phase
  artifacts, result documents) plus repo-level `tickets-index.json`,
  `counters.json`, `metrics.json`, per-checkout session pointers, and
  `archive/` for merged tickets.
- Helper CLIs: `skill-start.py`, `new-ticket.py`, `handoff.py`,
  `validate_xml.py` (under `hooks/scripts/`).
- JSON Schemas for every workspace document
  (`plugins/acs/schemas/*.schema.json`).
- XSD-defined XML messaging (`plugins/acs/schemas/acs-messages.xsd`):
  `task`, `result`, and `handoff` messages between coordinator and subagents.
- Description templates (`plugins/acs/templates/`): `epic-default.md`,
  `story-default.md`, `task-default.md`, `pr-default.md`.
- Unit test suite (`tests/`) and CI: tests on Python 3.9 and 3.12, JSON and
  JSON Schema validation, XSD validation, hook-script byte-compilation, and
  skill/agent frontmatter checks.
- Automated release workflow: tags `v<version>` and publishes a GitHub
  release from the matching changelog section when the plugin manifest
  version changes on `main`.
